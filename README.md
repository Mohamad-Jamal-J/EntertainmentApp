Entertainment App
where you can read the world news and also enjoy your time with jokes. 
it's the right application to start your day with.

 i used 3 different webservices, to validate real emails, to fetch jokes, and to fetch news.


 i have followed the instructions very varefully:
 * well documented code, every method had a comment description for it.
 * maintained a good and acceptable life cycle for users and the errors or 
 * used varitey of layout managers: constraint layout, gridlayout, linear layouts, and nested linear layouts.
 * i've also used a varitey of views, like edit texts, textviews, buttons, spinners, listviews, imagebuttons, alert dialogs.
 * i've offered the best UX possible with my current knoweldge in this course, through interactions rich with feedbacks like button touch feedback and changing the background of images.
 * maintained easy to understand layouts and activities.
 * centeralized strings, colors, and styles where needed.
 * i locked the activites on portrait orientation so there was no need to implement any of the call back methods related to it.
 * annotated screenshots on my drive were provided with the submission memo on ritaj.
